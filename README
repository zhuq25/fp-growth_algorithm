This project implements the Frequent Pattern Growth algorithm for data mining in Java. 

### Directions ###
1. Prepare data in a tab delimited UTF-8 text file and input directory in FpTree and fileReader.
2. Set support rate to obtain the minimum support condition.
3. The output prints the minimum support condition, the CPU time, and the frequent itemsets
   with their respective counts.
